# Supply Chain Improvement

### Coordination

Coordination between 2 agents (buyer and vendor) is an important aspect to lead important benefits in the whole supply chain.
In file 'coordination.py' a simple algorithm for automated mediation between two agents with different objective functions (OF)
is presented, in order to make clear the concept.


A test relative to the same solution is presented in the tests folder into the file 'test_coordination.py'.
I'm aware that the example presented concerns a very easy problem where the agents have to minimize a convex function, i.e.
Figure 1: OF for Agent1 and Figure2: OF for Agent2.

The idea is just to provide an example reimplementable and equally good in many ither situation (see for instance Fink (2004),
Supply Chain Coordination by Means of Automated Negotiations. IEEE Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on 
Systems Science, 5-8).
