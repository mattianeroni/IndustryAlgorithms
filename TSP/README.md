### Travelling Salesman Problem

In this repository two algorithms able to provide a fast even if sub-ptimal solution for the well-known Travelling Salesman Problem are proposed.


#### Problem (problem.h)
A generator of random instances of the TSP.

#### Ant Colony Optimization (aco.h)
A metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behaviour of ants, originally proposed by Dorigo et al. (1996).

#### Greedy (greedy.h)
A simple greedy solution to the problem.
