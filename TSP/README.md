### Travelling Salesman Problem

In this repository two algorithms able to provide a fast even if sub-ptimal solution for the well-known Travelling Salesman Problem are proposed.


#### Problem
A generator of random instances of the TSP.

#### Ant Colony Optimization
A metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behaviour of ants, originally proposed by Dorigo et al. (1996).

#### Greedy
A simple greedy solution to the problem.
